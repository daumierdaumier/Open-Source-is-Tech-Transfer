## Open Source and Tech Transfer at Universities
Open-source technology plays a role in translating academic research into practical applications. Universities are increasingly adopting open-source principles to accelerate innovation, democratize access to cutting-edge technologies, and foster collaborative ecosystems. By sharing software, data, and research outputs openly, universities lower barriers to entry for industry and community partners, enabling faster adoption and adaptation of new discoveries. Open-source approaches also align with the mission of public institutions to disseminate knowledge widely, enhancing their societal impact.

Tech transfer offices at universities have started to embrace open-source models alongside traditional patenting and licensing strategies. Open-source licensing can enable broader dissemination of research software while maintaining attribution and usage guidelines. Open-source projects also serve as a foundation for startups, providing an avenue for student entrepreneurs and faculty researchers to develop commercial ventures around open tools and platforms. Universities with Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) can provide structured support for managing these efforts, fostering an environment where research-driven innovation thrives.

## Business Models for Open Source Companies
While open-source software is freely available, companies have developed diverse business models to monetize open-source projects while sustaining their growth and innovation. One common approach is the "freemium" model, where the core software is open-source, but premium features, plugins, or enterprise-level support are offered at a cost. Red Hat, for example, built its business by providing support and services for its enterprise Linux distribution, which is based on open-source code.

* Support & Q/A - (Red Hat) Add-on support and QA activities to an OSS project
* Dual Licensing - (MySQL) Offers copyleft open license and commercial license for businesses
* Open Core - (Cassandra) Offers core software under permissive license and additional enterprise products as paid license
* SaaS - (GitHub) Hosting and managing OSS project while adding enterprise features
* Hardware Model - (Digium) Sells patented hardware with open source software
* Embargo - (MariaDB) Additional features/development released to paying customers sooner than non-paying customers

Open-source companies also benefit from community contributions, which reduce development costs and enhance the product's value. By creating ecosystems around their platforms, they can build partnerships and generate revenue streams through training, certification programs, and ecosystem-related services. This symbiotic relationship between openness and profitability showcases the transformative potential of open-source business models in driving technological progress.

## Open Source Program Offices in Academic Institutions
An academic Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is defined as an organizational construct, situated in an academic research institution, supported by one or more individuals that acts as a convener, community steward, and center of competency for open source software. An academic OSPO may cover some or all of the following: funding and financial support, advocacy and policy, supporting the creation of new OSS by the academic community, community building, tools and infrastructure to support OSS, working with tech transfer and external partners, educational efforts, developing and sharing best practices. See more details [here](https://curioss.org/news/academic_ospo_defn/). 

While there is a lot of open source activites at academic institutions, there is a limited number of OSPOS. As of early 2025 the list includes (and by no means is limited to):

## Organizations that Support Open Source

### CURIOSS (Community for University and Research Institution OSPOs)
[CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) is a Community for University and Research Institution OSPOs. Our goals are to facilitate the networking and collaboration between CURIOSS representatives from universities and research institutions worldwide. CURIOSS was set up in 2023 with the support of a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. There is a great list of online recources here: [https://curioss.org/resources/](https://curioss.org/resources/)
### CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software)
[CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics, metrics models, and software to better understand open source community health on a global scale. CHAOSS is an acronym for Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software. Open source software is critically important for both individuals and organizations. This importance raises questions about how we understand the health of the open-source projects we rely on. Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts on the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects.
### HELIOS (Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship)
The (Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS Open)](https://www.heliosopen.org/) is a cohort of colleges and universities committed to collective action to advance open scholarship within and across their campuses. Leaders from US colleges and universities have joined this community of practice, working together to promote a more transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy research ecosystem.
### Center for Open Science (COS)
The [Center for Open Science (COS)](https://www.cos.io/) was founded in 2013 to start, scale, and sustain open research practices that will democratize access to research, improve inclusion of all stakeholders, enhance accountability to research integrity, facilitate the self-corrective process of science, expand transparency and sharing of all research content, and improve research rigor and reproducibility.
### Open Source Initiative (OSI)
The Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org/) is a California public benefit corporation, with 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, founded in 1998. We are actively involved in Open Source community-building, education, and public advocacy to promote awareness and the importance of non-proprietary software. OSI participates in Open Source conferences and events, to meet with open source developers and users, and to discuss with executives from the public and private sectors about how Open Source technologies, licenses, and models of development can provide economic and strategic advantages.
